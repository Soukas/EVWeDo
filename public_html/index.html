			<p>To Date, we are still at the humble orgins stage of the projects. So instead of individual pages, I will list some basic milestones we have reached on different projects</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>We have collected over 300 18650s! (see image below)</li>
			  <ul>
				<li>204 have already been packaged in 2 8s13p blocks to drive a 16 HP motor</li>
				<li>16 of the 20+ Amp drawl varity have been packaged for use in our homemade drone</li>
				<li>the remainder are devoid of meaning for the time being, we are inclined to sell them</li>
			  </ul>
			  <li>We are now on the 3rd revision of the homemade drone arms, and its custom FlightOS is now a stable loop</li>
			  <li>We now have enough batteries to start the 16 HP motor!.. If only we could settle on a final project</li>
			  <li>We have a website running, with a few articles soon to be published</li>
			</ul>
